    "## Short summary\n",
    "In this exercise you will: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Train CNN for a binary classification problem\n",
    "* Experiment with CNN network configuration\n",
    "* Visualize how CNN interprets the data\n",
    "* Train RNN on a time series prediction problem\n",
    "* Visualize how RNN hidden node activities\n",
    "* Sample from a RNN character model\n",

    "In this lab we will look at network architectures that are designed to handle specific kinds of data. Convolutional Neural Networks for image processing and Recurrent Neural Networks for time series processing\n",

    "## The data\n",
    "The first dataset consists of simple computer generated pictures, each of which will contain either a square or a circle. The task is to train a CNN to classify whether a picture contains a circle (class 0) or a square (class 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the MNIST database is also used for an optional exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset consists of pairs of times series. The input time series is a train of rectangle pulses, and the output is triangles, i.e. an up-ramp followed by a down-ramp. For more details see the cell *Ex3-1*. The task is to train a recurrent network that predicts the triangle time series from the pulse time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last exercise is using the Tensorflow source code (C++) represented as a long sequence of characters. See that cell for more details.\n",

    "## RNN: Sampling from a character model\n",
    "As a final exercise we are going to look into an example where a recurrent network is used to predict a sequence of characters. The model is autoregressive, meaning that the previous values $\\ldots, x_{i-2}, x_{i-1}$ is used to predict $x_i$. In the model characters are represented as vectors with the same number of elements as the number of unique characters in the sequence. The input in each sequence step is a single character, represented using \"one-hot\" coding, that is exactly one vector element is one, representing that particular character. The output is on the other hand a probability vector over all characters, which can be used to sample a character from the predictive distribution. To sample long sequences of characters, we feed one sampled character back into the network, to predict the character after that and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence of characters that we are going to train on is the source code of Tensorflow (C++). The size of the downloaded source code is approximately 14 Mb, which means about 14 million characters in the sequence. The number of unique characters is 103. Therefore the output layer consists of 103 nodes with a softmax activation function. The RNN model itself is rather large, it consists of two layers of 1024 LSTM nodes in each layer. In addition to that there are skip-layer connections from input to second hidden layer and skip connections from first hidden layer to the output layer. In total there are about 13.5 million weights in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model take too long time to train as part of this lab. It takes days rather than minutes to train! Therefore pre-trained weights are handed out as part of the lab material. This is the file that you needed to download from an external URL!\n",
    "\n",
    "Given such a model we can now \"sample\" from it. Given some initial sequence of characters, as a seed, we can run the model for a number of sequence steps in order to find the sequence of predicted characters. But we can do more! Since the output is a vector of probabilities for new characters we can sample from it. As an example assume we only have 5 characters in our vocabulary and the prediction for a new character is:\n",
    "\n",
    "(0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.0, 0.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "So the character represented by the third position would be selected since it has the largest probability. But if we treat these number as probabilities we can say that half of the times we are going to select the third character, 30% of the time we select the character represented by the second position and so on. To even make things more random we can modify these probabilities such that they become more equal (high temperature) or that the largest probability becomes even larger (small temperature). This temperature parameter *temp* can be changed so that the sampling becomes completely random (very high *temp*) or completely deterministic (very low *temp*).\n",
